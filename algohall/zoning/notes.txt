h = 800n^8
difference = h - s

do we know the value of h?
if we do know the actual value of h then we can keep a record of the
value of the side and the proximity to the value of h, then we are
picking the minimum proximity value.

we need to know if h can actually be calculated and if creating a list
or using a dictionary/hash map is allowed or if it decreases the time
complexity.
