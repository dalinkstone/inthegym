this repository stores all of the leetcode problems that I am currently working through and has them organized by level of difficulty

## the kinds of problems
the goal here is to use Neetcode to measure how I can improve my skills and as a path for completing the leetcode problems. This means that I will be targetting to something like ~300ish leetcode problems and writing out the python code examples for all of them.

## the language
I have chosen to do all of my leetcode problems in python for now because it is the language that I am most comfortable with and am the best yet. I would eventually want to complete them in a different language, but I'm unsure if that will end up being TypeScript, Ruby, or Go. For now, I think it is reasonable to say that I can apply the syntax of python in a good enough way that I could learn how to apply the direct algorithm or logic in another language.
