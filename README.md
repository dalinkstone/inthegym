this repository stores all of the leetcode problems that I am currently working through and has them organized by level of difficulty

## the kinds of problems
the goal here is to use Neetcode to measure how I can improve my skills and as a path for completing the leetcode problems. This means that I will be targetting to something like ~300ish leetcode problems and writing out the python code examples for all of them.

## the language
I have chosen to do my leetcode problems in both python and c++. the reason is simple. i want to use a high level, easy syntax language and i want to use a low-level systems language. c++ really isn't the worst language to write code in. it's just awkward and different.
